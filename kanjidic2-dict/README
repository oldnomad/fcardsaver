KANJIDIC2 Conversion Tools
==========================

Scripts in this directory are used to convert KANJIDIC2 XML file, available
from <http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic2/>, into a set of
tab-separated text dictionary files compatible with FCardSaver.

Prerequisites for running the tools are:

   - Perl 5 or higher.
   - xsltproc tool from LibXSLT library, supporting EXSLT extensions
     <http://exslt.org/strings> and <http://exslt.org/functions>.

If you want to update the dictionaries, do following:

   1a. Run 'make download'. This re-downloads the GZipped KANJIDIC2 XML file.

_OR_

   1b. Download new version of KANJIDIC2 XML file manually. Note that the file
       downloaded from the link above is packed with GZip, and should be placed
       into the same directory as the tools.

   2. Run 'make'.
