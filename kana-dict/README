KANA Conversion Tools
=====================

Scripts in this directory are used to convert kana XML file into a set of
tab-separated text dictionary files compatible with FCardSaver.

Prerequisites for running the tools are:

   - Perl 5 or higher with installed modules "Unicode::Normalize" and
     "Text::CSV_XS".
   - xsltproc tool from LibXSLT library, supporting EXSLT extensions
     <http://exslt.org/strings> and <http://exslt.org/functions>.

If you want to update the dictionaries, do following:

   1. Modify "kana.xml" file. Its structure is described in comments in
      corresponding DTD file "kana.dtd".

   2. Run script "make".
