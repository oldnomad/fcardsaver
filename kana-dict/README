KANA Conversion Tools
=====================

Scripts in this directory are used to convert kana CSV file into a set of
tab-separated text dictionary files compatible with FCardSaver.

Prerequisites for running the tools are:

   - Perl 5 or higher with installed modules "Unicode::Normalize" and
     "Text::CSV_XS".

If you want to update the dictionaries, do following:

   1. Modify "kana.tsv" file.
   2. Run script "build-kana.pl" with argument specifying destination
      directory.

File "kana.tsv" contains following columns:

   1. Hiragana character.
   2. Katakana character.
   3. Latin transliterations for naked character, character with dakuten mark,
      character with handakuten mark (if applicable).
   4. Latin transliterations for open yoon (-y-) without vowel: naked character,
      character with dakuten mark, character with handakuten mark (if
      applicable).
   5. Latin transliterations for closed yoon (-w-) without vowel: naked
      character, character with dakuten mark, character with handakuten mark
      (if applicable).

   Latin transliterations are separated by pipe ('|') characters. Prefix
   ampersand ('&') character means that this combination occurs only in
   katakana. Prefix exclamation mark ('!') means that this is an alien
   combination (e.g. used for Ainu language).
