  == Attribute "mark" contains modifier mark. Dakuten (mark "d") and handakuten

  == Romaji reading tag
  ==
  == Tag contains a romaji reading of the sign with modifiers specified in the
  == attributes. See below.
  ==
  == Attribute "mark", if specified, contains voicing modifier mark: dakuten
  == ("d") or handakuten ("h"). The reading contains corresponding voiced or
  == half-voiced consonant.
  ==
  == Attribute "youon", if specified, contains youon mode: open ("y") or closed
  == ("w"). The reading contains youon reading without the vowel, e.g. ni -> ny.
  ==
  == Attribute "katakana", if not empty, means that the reading is only valid
  == in katakana. Corresponding combination will be omitted in generating
  == hiragana dictionaries. This is typical for Ainu kana.
  ==
  == Attribute "set", if specified, contains name of a non-standard set to
  == which this combination belongs. Note that set "ext" ("hiragana-ext" and
  == "katakana-ext") is generated automatically from all combinations with
  == voicing marks or youon that do not specify another set.
