{"body":"### About this project\r\nFCardSaver is a general-purpose flashcard-showing screensaver. It is designed in Qt framework and works both under X11 and under Microsoft Windows (XP or higher).\r\n\r\n### Historical notes\r\nLong-long ago there existed two screensavers for people studying Japanese language: [kanjisaver](http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/kanjisaver?content=31660) that displayed kanji from the JLPT set, and [kannasaver](http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/kannasaver?content=16792) that displayed kana, both by Ryan Schultz. Unfortunately, both projects were eventually orphaned (kanjisaver [here](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=510529) and kannasaver [here](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=510534)), and, as a result, dropped from Debian and from most Debian-based distributions, including Ubuntu which I use. Kannasaver was temporarily [resurrected](https://looksblo.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/kannasaver-1-2-for-kde-4-released/) in February 2011 by another maintainer, but after two releases dropped from the radar again.\r\n\r\nFor some time I lived with an old version of kannasaver, patching them to the best of my ability, but it wasn't a good experience for sure. Pretty soon I was thinking about writing a screensaver of my own, unifying functionality of both old screensavers. After one or two false starts I finally settled on the functionality that I want from the screensaver, and, in summer 2012, started writing. I chose Qt as a framework because I wanted the screensaver to work both under KDE and under Microsoft Windows, which I still have to use at work.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
