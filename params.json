It is designed in Qt framework and works both under X11 and under Microsoft Windows (XP or higher).\r\n\r\n### Binary builds\r\nBinary builds for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) are available at my [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~the-old-nomad/+archive/fcardsaver). These builds also install without problems on Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal).\r\n\r\nBinary builds for Microsoft Windows are not provided yet. FCardSaver builds successfully on Windows, but there are some problems with the installer. In particular, current installer installs Qt and MinGW runtime DLLs directly in `%SYSDIR%`. This can be a problem if you are using another Qt-dependent or MinGW-dependent application that requires newer DLLs than those included in FCardSaver installer.\r\n\r\n### Historical notes\r\nLong-long ago there existed two screensavers for people studying Japanese language: [kanjisaver](http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/kanjisaver?content=31660) that displayed kanji from the JLPT set, and [kannasaver](http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/kannasaver?content=16792) that displayed kana, both by Ryan Schultz. Unfortunately, both projects were eventually orphaned (kanjisaver [here](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=510529) and kannasaver [here](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=510534)), and, as a result, dropped from Debian and from most Debian-based distributions, including Ubuntu which I use. Kannasaver was temporarily [resurrected](https://looksblo.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/kannasaver-1-2-for-kde-4-released/) in February 2011 by another maintainer, but after two releases dropped from the radar again.\r\n\r\nFor some time I lived with an old version of kannasaver, patching it to the best of my ability, but it wasn't a good experience for sure. Pretty soon I was thinking about writing a screensaver of my own, unifying functionality of both old screensavers. After one or two false starts I finally settled on the functionality that I want from the screensaver, and, in spring 2012, started writing. I chose Qt as a framework because I wanted the screensaver to work both under KDE and under Microsoft Windows, which I still have to use at work.\r\n\r\nPretty soon the project started to grow and become more and more generic. Not satisfied by simply displaying a kanji or a kana character in the centre of the screen, it now could display arbitrary data in a rectangular grid. Kanji and kana sets, instead of being hard-coded as in the old screensavers, migrated to external files in format pretty close to that used by [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/). For kanji set generation I used a comprehensive and well-maintained [KANJIDIC2](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic2/) dictionary.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FCardSaver (1) is my first attemt at Debian packaging; (2) is my first attempt at writing in Qt; and (3) was not intended to be a serious project in the beginning.\r\n","google":"","tagline":"Flash Card Screensaver (X11/WinAPI)."}
