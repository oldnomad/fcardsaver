        <h3>About this project</h3>

<p>FCardSaver is a general-purpose flashcard-showing screensaver. It is designed in Qt framework and works both under X11 and under Microsoft Windows (XP or higher).</p>

<h3>Binary builds</h3>

<p>Binary builds for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) are available at my <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Ethe-old-nomad/+archive/fcardsaver">PPA</a>. These builds also install without problems on Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal).</p>

<p>Binary builds for Microsoft Windows are not provided yet.</p>

<h3>Historical notes</h3>

<p>Long-long ago there existed two screensavers for people studying Japanese language: <a href="http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/kanjisaver?content=31660">kanjisaver</a> that displayed kanji from the JLPT set, and <a href="http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/kannasaver?content=16792">kannasaver</a> that displayed kana, both by Ryan Schultz. Unfortunately, both projects were eventually orphaned (kanjisaver <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=510529">here</a> and kannasaver <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=510534">here</a>), and, as a result, dropped from Debian and from most Debian-based distributions, including Ubuntu which I use. Kannasaver was temporarily <a href="https://looksblo.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/kannasaver-1-2-for-kde-4-released/">resurrected</a> in February 2011 by another maintainer, but after two releases dropped from the radar again.</p>

<p>For some time I lived with an old version of kannasaver, patching it to the best of my ability, but it wasn't a good experience for sure. Pretty soon I was thinking about writing a screensaver of my own, unifying functionality of both old screensavers. After one or two false starts I finally settled on the functionality that I want from the screensaver, and, in the autumn of 2012, the screensaver ran for the first time. I chose Qt as a framework because I wanted the screensaver to work both under KDE and under Microsoft Windows, which I still have to use at work.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the project started to grow and become more and more generic. Not satisfied by simply displaying a kanji or a kana character in the centre of the screen, it now could display arbitrary data in a rectangular grid. Kanji and kana sets, instead of being hard-coded as in the old screensavers, migrated to external files in format pretty close to that used by <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a>. For kanji set generation I used a comprehensive and well-maintained <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/%7Ejwb/kanjidic2/">KANJIDIC2</a> dictionary.</p>

<p>Please note that FCardSaver (1) is my first attemt at Debian packaging; (2) is my first attempt at writing in Qt; and (3) was not intended to be a serious project in the beginning.</p>
